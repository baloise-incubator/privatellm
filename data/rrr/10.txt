10. The History of Human Rights:
The concept of human rights has evolved over centuries. From the Magna Carta in 1215 to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, societies have recognized the importance of protecting individual freedoms and dignity. Human rights encompass civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, with the aim of ensuring equality and justice for all. The struggle for human rights continues in the face of global challenges, reminding us of the ongoing work required to uphold these principles.
