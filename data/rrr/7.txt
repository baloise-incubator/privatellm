7. The Future of Renewable Energy:
As the world seeks sustainable energy sources, renewable energy is gaining prominence. Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power offer cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. Advances in energy storage and distribution are making renewable energy more reliable and accessible. Transitioning to renewables can mitigate climate change and reduce our dependence on finite resources. However, challenges such as energy storage and infrastructure upgrades must be addressed to fully realize the potential of renewable energy.
